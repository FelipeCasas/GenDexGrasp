## Dependencies

Run the following to install a subset of necessary python packages for our code

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note that the `pytorch_kinematics` dependency is modified, you should install it from the source code in `thirdparty/pytorch_kinematics/`



## Data Preparation

#### Robots and Objects

We train and test on 58 daily objects from the YCB and ContactDB dataset, together with 5 robotic hands(EZGripper, Barrett Hand, Robotiq-3F, Allegro and Shadowhand) ranging from two to five fingers.

#### Grasp Dataset



#### Contact Map Dataset
